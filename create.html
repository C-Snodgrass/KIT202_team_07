<!-- This page provides a mechanism for creating new blog posts. -->
<!-- - The page should include a form element with input fields for the postâ€™s title, tags/keywords, and content with a button -->
<!--   to create the post and a button to reset the form. -->
<!-- - Include JavaScript field validation to prevent the form from being submitted if: -->
<!--     - any of the fields are empty -->
<!--     - the title field exceeds 70 characters -->
<!-- - As with the login and registration forms, your field validation should include the display of appropriate error messages -->
<!--   to notify the user and visual style changes to indicate fields that require attention. -->
<!-- - Clicking the reset button should clear all form field values. -->
<!-- - For this assignment, submitting the form should also take the user back to the home page4. -->

                    <h4>How did our group choose the subject matter and theme?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Our group thought of a few ideas for our subject matter and theme before we settled on a book blog.
                        The reason for this is that, a book theme gives us lots of options and flexibilty on what we want
                        to do, as we can be as narrow or as broad as we would like. Upon reflection it was found that books
                        and they way they are stored are reflect the structure of a web page.
                    </p>
                        
                    <h4>How did our group come up with the asthethic design?</h4>
                    <p>
                        James and Chris had a brief discussion of favoured text edditor colour paletts. While neither of them
                        use the Gruvbox theme it was decided the middle of the road beige, and retro 70s esque color theme would
                        suit the bland toppic of books, books, books.
                    </p>
                        
                    <h4>When choosing our site design, what considerations did we make?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Ease of readability was high on the list of priorities. We wanted the site to have enough contrast to be
                        easily legible, however we did not want to burn out the viewer's retteners. Was also aimed to keep the 
                        content centered so as the viewer did not have to chase the it around the screen. Similar pirincipals
                        to text edditing and code.

                        <h4>Why did our group add these embelishments, what was the purpose?</h4>
                        <p>
                            It was decided that a dark mode would dovetail into our core consideration of legibility without being
                            too bright. The sticky nav bar ensured that content on other pages could be easily access no matter where
                            the user found themseleves keeping content easiliy accessible. This same principal is why we added the 
                            Top of the page link, however that was omitted from pages with insufficient content.
                        </p>
                        <h4>How did our group implement these embelishments?</h4>
                        <p>
                            dark mode... all colours are accessed through variable, these variables are held in two seperate classes,
                            one "light" the other "dark". These classes can be applied to the body. A checkbox (with a hidden box) 
                            was made and and event listener listens to see if the box is ticed if so the class is changed in the body
                            and the SVG is changed in the logo / checkbox. 
                            <br>
                            Sticky bar is as simple as one line of css
                            <code>position: sticky;</code>
                            <br>
                            as is the top of the page link, if we want we should probably put it in a button?? 
                            its simply a href which quals "#top", guess that's a reserved word.

                        <h4>Was our group faced with challenges implementing these embelishments? How did we overcome them?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Chris had a great deal of trouble implimenting persistance with the dark mode, however with the aide
                            of the internet and the console he was eventally consoled, when it worked.

                            Working in a distributed maner was difficult, non of us being particularly adept with git. However
                            with patience and teamwork we overcome the challanges

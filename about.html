• Include responses to the following:
    o Describe the subject matter and theme your group chose for the blog.
        ▪ Why did you choose it?
        ▪ How did your group come up with the aesthetic design?
        ▪ What did you consider when choosing colours, fonts, etc?
    o Explain your group’s password policy for new user registration.
        ▪ How did you implement it?
        ▪ How did you validate the password fields against the policy?
    o Explain how your group decided to handle new user registration.
    (either dynamically changing the login form or redirecting to a new page)
        ▪ Why did you opt for this method?
    o Describe, in detail, the embellishment/s your group incorporated beyond the core specifications.
        ▪ What embellishments have you added?
        ▪ Why did you choose them… what do they add to your blog?

        ▪ Did you face any challenges with implementation? If so, what were they and how did you overcome them?
        • A one sentence response to these questions is not sufficient. You will need to include appropriate detail to adequately
        answer each question, so well thought out and justified answers will consist of multiple paragraphs.
    o Feel free to be include diagrams or illustrations on this page if it helps with your explanations.
        • You should also include a reference list for all assets not created by your group (e.g., images, fonts, icons, etc.) that are

                        <h4>How did our group choose the subject matter and theme?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Our group thought of a few ideas for our subject matter and theme before we settled on a book blog.
                            The reason for this is that, a book theme gives us lots of options and flexibilty on what we want
                            to do, as we can be as narrow or as broad as we would like. Upon reflection it was found that books
                            and they way they are stored are reflect the structure of a web page.
                        </p>
                            
                        <h4>How did our group come up with the asthethic design?</h4>
                        <p>
                            James and Chris had a brief discussion of favoured text edditor colour paletts. While neither of them
                            use the Gruvbox theme it was decided the middle of the road beige, and retro 70s esque color theme would
                            suit the bland toppic of books, books, books.

                            The asthetic design was based around books and a library which seemed fitting given the subject matter was books.
                        </p>
                            
                        <h4>When choosing our site design, what considerations did we make?</h4>
                        <p>
                            Ease of readability was high on the list of priorities. We wanted the site to have enough contrast to be
                            easily legible, however we did not want to burn out the viewer's retteners. Was also aimed to keep the 
                            content centered so as the viewer did not have to chase the it around the screen. Similar pirincipals
                            to text edditing and code.

                            We decided that the site design needed to be user friendly and intuitive.  That is it was obvious what info
                            was required from the user and where.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        <h3>The password policy for new users</h3>
                        <button class="aboutBtn" id="aboutBtn2">Show</button>
                        <div class="aboutBox hide" id="aboutContent2" name="passwordPolicy">
                            <h4>How did our group implement our password policy?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Our password policy was designed to make the user login information as secure as possible but at the same time
                                striking the balance between ease of use and security.  We decided on an alpha numeric password 6-12 characters long.
                            </p>
                                
                            <h4>How did our group validate the password fields against this policy?</h4>
                            <p>
                                The password had required sybmols and alpha numeric requirements which was validated using pattern matching in the password input type.
                            </p>

                                We registered users on a new page for ease of use as well as making it easier to validate using JS

                            </p>
                            <h4>Why did our group add these embelishments, what was the purpose?</h4>
                            <p>
                                It was decided that a dark mode would dovetail into our core consideration of legibility without being
                                too bright. The sticky nav bar ensured that content on other pages could be easily access no matter where
                                the user found themseleves keeping content easiliy accessible. This same principal is why we added the 
                                Top of the page link, however that was omitted from pages with insufficient content.

                                We used the emblishments to aid the usability of the website as well as directing the user where their action was required.
                            </p>
                            <h4>How did our group implement these embelishments?</h4>
                            <p>
                                dark mode... all colours are accessed through variable, these variables are held in two seperate classes,
                                one "light" the other "dark". These classes can be applied to the body. A checkbox (with a hidden box) 
                                was made and and event listener listens to see if the box is ticed if so the class is changed in the body
                                and the SVG is changed in the logo / checkbox. 
                                <br>
                                Sticky bar is as simple as one line of css
                                <code>position: sticky;</code>
                                <br>
                                as is the top of the page link, if we want we should probably put it in a button?? 
                                its simply a href which quals "#top", guess that's a reserved word.

                                Our group implmented the emblishments by embedding them in the headers, titles and background.  We also used
                                buttons and links aid in navigation and use of the page.
                            </p> 
                            <h4>Was our group faced with challenges implementing these embelishments? How did we overcome them?</h4>
                            <p>
                                Chris had a great deal of trouble implimenting persistance with the dark mode, however with the aide
                                of the internet and the console he was eventally consoled, when it worked.

                                Working in a distributed maner was difficult, non of us being particularly adept with git. However
                                with patience and teamwork we overcome the challanges

                                The challenges of implmenting these emblishments was around formatting and ensuring the functionality worked as intended.

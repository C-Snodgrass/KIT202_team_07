<!-- This page is for your group to provide an explanation of your implemented functionality.
• Include the names and student IDs of each group member.
• Include responses to the following:
    o Describe the subject matter and theme your group chose for the blog.
        ▪ Why did you choose it?
        ▪ How did your group come up with the aesthetic design?
        ▪ What did you consider when choosing colours, fonts, etc?
    o Explain your group’s password policy for new user registration.
        ▪ How did you implement it?
        ▪ How did you validate the password fields against the policy?
    o Explain how your group decided to handle new user registration.
    (either dynamically changing the login form or redirecting to a new page)
        ▪ Why did you opt for this method?
    o Describe, in detail, the embellishment/s your group incorporated beyond the core specifications.
        ▪ What embellishments have you added?
        ▪ Why did you choose them… what do they add to your blog?
        ▪ How did you implement them?
        ▪ Did you face any challenges with implementation? If so, what were they and how did you overcome them?
        • A one sentence response to these questions is not sufficient. You will need to include appropriate detail to adequately
        answer each question, so well thought out and justified answers will consist of multiple paragraphs.
    o Feel free to be include diagrams or illustrations on this page if it helps with your explanations.
        • You should also include a reference list for all assets not created by your group (e.g., images, fonts, icons, etc.) that are
        used as part of your blog design. -->

                            Our group thought of a few idea for our subject matter and theme before we settled on a book blog.
                            The reason for this is that, a book theme gives us lots of options and flexibilty on what we want
                            to do, as we can be as narrow or as broad as we would like.

<!-- Your group will need to decide between implementing user registration on the Login page by changing the -->
<!-- displayed form (with JavaScript) or directing the user to a separate registration page (register.html). -->

<!-- Whichever option you choose, the expected functionality of the registration form is as follows: -->
<!-- - The form should comprise a username, email address, password, and confirm password field together with a button to -->
<!--   register and a button to reset the form fields values. -->
<!-- - Within your group, decide on a password policy to implement. -->
<!--     - Your policy should incorporate a minimum length and a required combination of letters (uppercase and -->
<!--       lowercase), digits (0â€“9), or symbols/special characters. -->
<!-- - Include JavaScript field validation to prevent the registration form from being submitted if: -->
<!--     - any of the fields are empty -->
<!--     - the email address field does not contain a valid email address -->
<!--     - the password and confirm password fields do not match (i.e., do not contain the same value) -->
<!--     - the password does not conform to your password policy -->
<!-- - As with the login form, your field validation should include the display of appropriate error messages to notify the user -->
<!--   and visual style changes to indicate those fields that require attention. -->
<!-- - Clicking the reset button should clear all form field values. -->
<!-- - For this assignment, submitting the registration form should also take the user back to the home page. -->
